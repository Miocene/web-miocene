Hey there, CSS friends! It's a growing collection of shape tricks, all crafted using pure CSS. Each shape comes with code snippets, so you can easily integrate them and experiment with different approaches.

There are many reasons to use CSS shapes instead of SVG, here you can find different examples and useful links.

## Border radius

This property is quite simple but very useful. Unfortunately, it cannot draw a squircle... ***yet***.

import BorderRadiusDemo from './shapes/border-radius-demo.md';

<BorderRadiusDemo />

## Box-shadow

✅ This property can help you to copy the shape of your block. 

✅ It copies a shape even if the block doesn't have a background.

✅ It draws a shape both inside and ouside of the block.

✅ The shadow could be bigger or smaller than the original block. It controls by the spread value `box-shadow: x y blur spread color`.

✅ There could be any amount of shadows.

⚠️ It copies the shape of the root element. Chindren don't affect the shape of the shadow.

❌ The shadow is not visible behind the root element even if it has no background.

❌ Can't copy the complex shape.

import BoxShadowDemo from './shapes/box-shadow-demo.md';

<BoxShadowDemo />

## Drop shadow

✅ This property can help you to copy the shape of your block.

✅ Can't copy the complex shape.

✅ There could be any amount of shadows.

✅ The shadow is visible behind the root element.

⚠️ It copies all the non-transparent pixels within this block.

⚠️ It copies the shape of the root element and all the chindren inside.

⚠️ Every next `drop-shadow` copies the shape of the original block and all the shadows before.

❌ It draws a shape only ouside of the block.

❌ The shadow could only be the same size as the original block.

import DropShadowDemo from './shapes/drop-shadow-demo.md';

<DropShadowDemo />

## Mask

Masks create a clipping region that defines which part of an element should be visible. Parts within the region are shown, while those outside are hidden. If you've eved used a `background` to draw a gradient, you already know how to use `mask`. There are the same family-propeties: `mask-image`, `mask-position`, `mask-size`, `mask-repeat`.

import MaskDemo from './shapes/mask-demo.md';

<MaskDemo />

## Clip path

Masks create a clipping region that defines which part of an element should be visible. Parts within the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.

## Background

The most powerful property. You can create a world with just a gradient and one block!

<BackgroundDemo />

## Transform

import TransformDemo from './shapes/transform-demo.md';

## Border

This approach is useful for blocks with no content and plain background.
