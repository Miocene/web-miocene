Hey there, CSS fans! This is the third part of a 3D series. The first one is [here](/post/3d-cube-with-css), the second is [here](/post/light-and-shadow-in-css), start from there if you missed any of them.

Before your character takes a single step, there’s one thing it absolutely needs: a **skeleton**.

In CSS animation, the skeleton isn’t bones and cartilage — it’s **HTML structure and `transform-origin`**. It’s the thing that makes your character move like a character and not like a stack of divs having an existential crisis.

## Why Your Character Needs a Skeleton

Imagine animating a chicken. You want it to jump. You’ve already [built it](/post/3d-cube-with-css#make-it-more-creative), [colored it](/post/light-and-shadow-in-css#shadows-on-the-object), and now… it’s time to move.

Without a skeleton, that means animating **each part** of the chicken individually. The head, the wings, the legs — all getting their own keyframes. It’s like micromanaging limbs in five timelines at once.

import Example1 from './css-character-skeleton/example1.md';

<Example1 />

Now imagine that chicken needs to dance. _No thanks._

A proper HTML skeleton saves you from this nightmare. It turns chaos into structure, and lets you focus on how your character moves — not how to keep it from falling apart.

## The Chicken's Skeleton

Let’s break down our chicken’s structure. Start from the body, then nest all the connected parts — like joints in real anatomy.

import Example2 from './css-character-skeleton/example2.md';

<Example2 />

Each moving part is **nested inside** the one it’s attached to. Shoulder inside the body, arm inside the shoulder, hand inside the arm, finger inside the hand, and so on.

Want to add a hat? Drop it in the head element. A sword? Goes in the hand element. The HTML _is_ the skeleton.

## Let’s talk joints

Every animated element transforms (rotates) from one pont. In CSS, that point is `transform-origin`.

By default, it’s in the center of the element. But for a character, that’s usually wrong. Your chicken’s wing doesn’t flap from the middle. You’ll need to [manually set the anchor point](/post/3d-cube-with-css#basic-3d-object) — usually at the joint.

- **Rounded** character joints are circles.
- **Cubic** character joints are corner or center points.
- **Realistic** character joints are spheric.

import Example3 from './css-character-skeleton/example3.md';

<Example3 />

Position `transform-origin` based on **how the character would move in real life**. It sounds like overkill — it’s not. It’s what makes movement feel *natural*.

## Animation Magic

Here’s the cool part: when you nest joints correctly, you only have to animate **one thing**. If you don’t nest? You’re stuck micromanaging every angle on every frame. Nightmare.

Compare these two examples: the one you already saw before and the one with a proper nesting.

import Example4 from './css-character-skeleton/example4.md';

<Example4 />

CSS animation doesn’t have to be hard — just **smart**.

## Want That Wiggly, Spaghetti-Limb Vibe?

Want spagetti movement? Here’s a trick: create more joints for each body parts. I did it for a [mosquito nose](/demo/mosquito). It consists of a few joints connecting small nose parts. Nest them and place their `transform-origin` like with a normal character, and suddenly... *you’ve got a sausage-shaped nose that bends like it’s made of rubber.*

import Example5 from './css-character-skeleton/example5.md';

<Example5 />

import Example7 from './css-character-skeleton/example7.md';

<Example7 />

The more elements you add, the more rubbery it will look.

## Demo Time

Let’s look at the simple cube characters dancing — powered by proper skeletons and smart nesting.

import Example6 from './css-character-skeleton/example6.md';

<Example6 />

## Takeaways

- Nest your elements by anatomy
- Set `transform-origin` like real joints
- Use structure to simplify animation

That’s the skeleton in a nutshell!
